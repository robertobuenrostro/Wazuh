## Wazuh

## Objective 

>This project documents my learning journey while setting up and working with Wazuh in a virtual lab environment. Iâ€™m using this experience to build a foundation in threat detection, system monitoring, and vulnerability management, while learning how Security Operations Centers protect systems in the real world.

## Skills Learned

### Virtual Lab Setup
>Installed and networked Ubuntu VMs using VMware and Proxmox for a functional SIEM lab.

### Wazuh Deployment
>Set up Wazuh Manager and Agent for endpoint monitoring and log analysis.

### Vulnerability Detection & Remediation
>Identified active CVEs (e.g., CVE-2023-3326, CVE-2024-11693) and applied security patches to harden the system.

### Linux System Hardening
>Performed updates, checked file permissions, reviewed services, and validated firewall status.

### Command Line & Troubleshooting
>Used tools like apt, ufw,debsecan, netstat, and systemctl to debug network and system issues.

### SIEM Dashboard Navigation
>Explored the Wazuh interface to view alerts, monitor activity, and understand security events.

### Documentation & Learning Process
>Recorded each step with clear explanations to reflect my learning journey and growing SOC analyst skillset.
