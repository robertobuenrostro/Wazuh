## Wazuh

## Objective 

>This project documents my learning journey while setting up and working with Wazuh in a virtual lab environment. Iâ€™m using this experience to build a foundation in threat detection, system monitoring, and vulnerability management, while learning how Security Operations Centers protect systems in the real world.

>Set up Wazuh Manager and Agent for endpoint monitoring and log analysis.

# Vulnerability Detection & Remediation
>Identified active CVEs (e.g., CVE-2023-3326, CVE-2024-11693) and applied security patches to harden the system.

# Linux System Hardening
>Performed updates, checked file permissions, reviewed services, and validated firewall status.

# Command Line & Troubleshooting
>Used tools like apt, ufw,debsecan, netstat, and systemctl to debug network and system issues.

# SIEM Dashboard Navigation
